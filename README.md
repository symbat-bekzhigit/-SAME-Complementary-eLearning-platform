# SAME-Complementary-eLearning-platform

**SDG Goal:** Quality Education (Goal #4)
**Product:** A supplementary online learning platform designed for high school students that leverages VR/AR/Interactive technologies

Our vision is to create an innovative online learning platform that harnesses the power of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize education. Our platform is designed to provide school students with immersive and playful learning experiences, allowing them to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various subjects. Whether it's conducting biology lab experiments, delving into coding challenges, or exploring other topics, our platform offers a diverse range of features, programs, and activities tailored to each subject's unique requirements.
For instance, in our coding program, students engage in head-to-head coding competitions where they create programs based on prompts provided by the platform. The AI algorithms analyze factors such as the time taken, code optimization, and overall performance, providing valuable feedback to help students identify their strengths and weaknesses. Our mission is to make high- quality education accessible to students worldwide. By eliminating the need for physical labs for subjects like physics and biology, our platform empowers learners to access these educational resources from anywhere, breaking down geographical and logistical barriers. We aspire to create a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that empowers students to thrive in an ever- evolving educational landscape.
